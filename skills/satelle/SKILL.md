# Satelle

Satelle is a remote computer-use bridge. Route to the smallest Satelle skill that can complete the job.

## Route

1. Use `satelle-setup` when the task is to install, configure, onboard, or verify a Satelle host before prompt execution.

Completion criterion: the agent has a setup plan, knows whether mutation consent is needed, and knows the next verification command.

2. Use `satelle-use` when the task is to run, steer, inspect, stop, or follow an existing Satelle session.

Completion criterion: the agent has used the session contract instead of treating a one-shot command as disposable state.

3. Use `satelle-recover` when setup, run, steer, status, logs, MCP, or host commands fail or produce readiness blockers.

Completion criterion: the agent has a typed failure, evidence from diagnostics or logs, and a recovery path that preserves state.

4. Stay in this router only for high-level explanation or when choosing among the other skills.

Completion criterion: the response names the specific skill to use next and why.

Discover the release-matched bundle with `satelle skills list`. Use `satelle skills get <name>` to read one guide or `satelle skills path <name>` when a client needs a local SKILL.md path.

## Rules

- Prefer Satelle JSON output for agent decisions.
- Treat `session_id` as the public handle. Do not depend on underlying Codex thread IDs.
- Do not handle raw provider secrets in chat, logs, facts, config snippets, or skill output.
- Do not use `--yes`, YOLO mode, raw diagnostic exports, or recording modes unless the user explicitly asks for that risk-bearing behavior.
