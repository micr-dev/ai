    Design, write, and review Effect service modules (Context.Service + Layer) using the riptide-api
    "deep module" pattern. Use when creating or changing an Effect service, external adapter, tagged
    error, layer, or its @effect/vitest tests; or when reviewing Effect code for module depth, typed-error
    capture-then-narrow, observability (spans/logs/Sentry), Config/Redacted secrets, and real-seam layer
    tests. The Slack service (apps/riptide-api/src/effects/services/slack) is the canonical reference.

# Effect Program Design

Build **deep** Effect service modules: a small, domain-shaped public surface hiding substantial behavior,
with typed success **and** error channels, declared dependencies, capture-then-narrow error handling, spans,
and tests that swap real layers at real seams. The Slack service is the gold standard. `workos`, `resend`,
`stripe`, and `s3` are shallow foils — do not copy them.

## The creed (non-negotiables)

1. **Deep modules.** The interface is the _cost_, the implementation is the _benefit_. Hide a lot behind a
   small, simple shape. The caller never learns the module's internals.
2. **Everything stays in Effect.** Typed success **and** error channels; dependencies declared in `R` (Effect
   services), never passed as arguments. No plain functions that receive/inspect errors or carry errors as values.
3. **Two-tier errors, capture-then-narrow.** Classify raw failures into tagged errors → capture (log + Sentry)
   **before** narrowing → map to a small, caller-actionable public union. `catchTag`/`catchTags` only — never
   `instanceof`, never `error._tag === '…'`.
4. **Observe everything.** A span per public method, structured logs, Sentry for the actionable/unexpected —
   all with safe fields, secrets `Redacted`.
5. **Testable by layer substitution.** Every service is exercised through its public interface with deps
   swapped as layers (`@effect/vitest` + `Effect.provide`). No module mocks, no method spies.

## 1. Anatomy — the file set

Split by responsibility. Names like `client`/`dispatch`/`persistence`/`oauth` are Slack-specific, not required.

| File                                         | Owns                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x.service.ts`                               | the `Context.Service` tag and shape; never an implementing layer                        |
| `x.layer.ts`                                 | the live `Layer` implementation; always separate from the service tag/shape             |
| `x.errors.ts`                                | all `Data.TaggedError` classes + the internal/public error unions                       |
| `x.types.ts`                                 | domain types (and optionally the service shape — both fine)                             |
| `x.client.ts`                                | the external adapter: wraps the SDK/HTTP, emits typed errors, owns the SDK-error mapper |
| `x.persistence.ts`                           | DB operations (Drizzle), each mapping driver errors to a tagged error                   |
| `x.<concern>.ts`                             | further sub-effects (dispatch/oauth/…) by responsibility                                |
| pure helpers (`format.ts`, `classify.ts`, …) | functional core — no I/O, no deps                                                       |

Service tags/shapes and implementing layers always live in separate files, even for small services. Split
additional implementation concerns when they span external-call, persistence, and orchestration.

## 2. Deep modules

- **Small, domain-shaped surface.** Few methods; each input/output a domain type; **each method's error union
  is small, caller-actionable, and distinct from (smaller than) the internal vocabulary.** Slack: 8 internal
  `SlackProviderError` tags → public `SlackConnectionError` (4); `dispatch*` advertises `never`.
- **The caller must not know the module's internals.** A service resolves the data that is its _own_ concern
  rather than making the caller fetch and pass it. `listChannels({ organizationId })` resolves the bot token
  internally; a shallow `listChannels({ botToken })` leaks an internal.
- **But accept the domain inputs the caller legitimately holds, as named types.** Not "pass a `taskId` and
  look it up" — if callers have the `Task`, take a `Task`. Don't destructure its fields into the signature.
- **IDs:** raw `string` is fine, but **always in a named input object** (`{ organizationId }`) — never positional
  bare strings or same-typed positional args. Branding is optional/aspirational.
- **Decision rule:** _to produce this argument, would the caller have to know how the module works inside?_
  Yes → the module resolves it. No, it's a value they already hold → accept it as its domain type.
- **Deletion test:** removing the module must _spread_ complexity to callers, not erase it. Shallow tells: a
  1:1 SDK/table mirror; an interface that makes callers supply internals.

## 3. Errors

- **`Data.TaggedError`** for every expected failure — stable tag, structured safe fields, optional `cause: unknown`.
- **Two tiers.** Internal: the rich vocabulary of everything that can break (transport + API-body + persistence).
  Public: a small union of caller-actionable outcomes per method.
- **Model the decision, not the status.** `SlackNeedsReauthError`, `retryable`, `…Unavailable`, `AlreadyRequested`
  — not `ServerError`/`RateLimitError` status buckets. Never make a caller string-match a message to recover a
  distinction (the workos `'already invited'` smell).
- **Classify in the channel.** Transform the **error channel** with `catchTags`/`mapError` on typed errors —
  not a plain `(cause: unknown) => Error`. Prefer SDKs that already emit typed errors (`@humanlayer/effect-slack`).
- **Throwing SDKs** (the one exception): `Effect.tryPromise({ try, catch })` where `catch` delegates to **one**
  per-adapter `mapSdkErrorToEffectError(cause) => TaggedError`. Centralized — no scattered cause-inspection,
  no `instanceof`, no `(x as any).status` sprinkled around.
- **Banned:** `instanceof` in Effect code; `error._tag === '…'` equality; raw/`unknown` errors leaked to callers;
  errors carried as values (`{ ok: false, error: string }`). Aggregate with `Effect.result` → `Result<A, E>`.

## 4. Effect purity & dependencies

- **Declare service deps in `R`** (`yield* PostgresDb`, `yield* WorkosService`). Never pass a service/layer as a
  function argument (`(workos) => Layer.succeed(...)` is wrong).
- **Effect-needs-effect → compose with the pipe pattern** (`.pipe` / `yield*` / `flatMap`), not by passing
  effects around. Passing an effect/capability is a rare, justified exception.
- **Effect-needs-layer** - prefer declaring the service as a dependency of the effect, rathern than inling the effect into the service
- Services composed of effects should declare the effects outside the body of the surface where posisble and model dependencies
    - E.g. an effect which depends on several layers, but which is part of the interface of some third layer - model the effect
      as its own effect which depends on the requisite services, then compose it into the service unless it requries access to the service's internals. This way
      the effect can be tested independently of the layer by providing test seams.
    - Services should almost never call `.provide` to provide an effect they use with a layer since effects should rely on
      the ambient service in the runtime, the exception to this is if the effect requires a custom HTTPClient or something
      which needs to be created and closed around correct fresh credentials _at call time / runtime_ and cannot be composed
      at runtime-construction-time
- The functional core (parsers, formatting, decisions) is pure — no I/O, no logger, no ambient time/randomnes.
  The imperative shell (the layer + adapters) sequences effects, does I/O, classifies failures, observes.

## 5. Observability — three channels

- **Spans (required).** One `Effect.withSpan('service_name.operation', { attributes })` per **public method**,
  plus **child spans for sub-effects that do I/O or are expensive**, **none for pure helpers**. Add safe context
  with `Effect.annotateCurrentSpan({...})`. Naming: `snake_case` `domain.operation` (`slack.list_channels`).
  Spans live **inside** the service, not only at the orpc handler.
- **Logs.** `Effect.logError` (+ `logDebug`/`logInfo` for notable events) with `Effect.annotateLogs({...})`.
  Reuse the **same attribute object** for logs and spans; `Effect.withLogSpan(...)` for log spans
- **Sentry — actionable or unexpected only.** `Sentry.captureException(error, { tags: { error_type }, extra })`
  for integration/transport breakage, defects (via `catchCause`), and anything degrading a capability a human
  should see. **Not** pure control-flow / input validation (`SlackNotConnectedError`, `…ValidationError`).
- **Capture before you narrow or swallow.** `tapError(log)` + `tapError(Sentry)` on the **raw** error _before_
  `catchTags`. Best-effort work captures, then swallows — never swallows silently. Top-level nets use
  `catchCause` (catches defects too), not just `catchTag`.
- **Safe fields only.** Domain IDs, operation, provider, tags, `has_access_token: Boolean(...)`. Secrets are
  `Redacted` and never logged/spanned.

## 6. Config & secrets

- Load **all env vars and secrets via Effect `Config`** (`Config.string` / `Config.redacted` / `Config.url`,
  `Config.withDefault(...)`) inside the layer's `Effect.gen`. No `process.env` in service logic.
- Secrets are `Redacted` end-to-end; `Redacted.value(...)` **only at the adapter edge** making the call.
- `Config`-based loading is what makes the service testable without env (tests inject `ConfigProvider`).

## 7. Boundaries & DB rows

- **Parse untrusted boundaries into domain types** at the adapter edge (HTTP/SDK/JSON/webhooks/user input).
  Slack maps raw `conversations.list` objects → `SlackChannel`. Parsing of inbound request bodies happens at
  the oRPC/webhook entrypoint; the service receives already-parsed domain inputs. Use Effect Schema
  with schema-driven data modelling: https://effect-ts-effect-smol.mintlify.app/core-modules/schema and https://www.effect.solutions/data-modeling
- **DB rows: scalar trust, jsonb parse.** Trust Drizzle `$inferSelect` types for straightforward scalar columns
  (Postgres enforces them). **Parse `jsonb`** — Postgres does not enforce jsonb shape — with the existing **Zod**
  schemas (`@codelayer/db/zodschemas/*`, `drizzle-zod` select schemas). No Effect Schema bridging.
- **Never return a raw `$inferSelect` row across the public interface** — project to a domain type
  (Slack returns `SlackConnectionStatus`, not the integration row).
- `parseX` / `makeX` / `isX` naming (avoid `validateX`); no generic `isRecord`/`isObject` guards; no `as T` on
  decoded JSON or rows.

## 8. Async & workflows

- **Bounded concurrency** for unbounded/fan-out work (`Effect.forEach(xs, f, { concurrency })`); start independent
  work together rather than awaiting in a loop.
- Leverage fibers where appropriate, with scopes, acquireRelease etc for managing resources - particularly
  resources which must be cleaned up: https://effect-ts-effect-smol.mintlify.app/core-concepts/resources-and-scopes
- **Idempotency** on retried creates (idempotency keys; `onConflictDoNothing` claims). **Atomic transition guards**
  for lifecycle writes (the Slack thread-claim via `acquireUseRelease`). Do **not** hold a DB transaction open
  across a network call.
- **Best-effort / `Effect<void, never>`** is the right shape for fan-out/notification side-effects where one
  failure must not fail the caller: capture (log + Sentry) then swallow; surface a typed error only when the
  caller can act on it. Defects should always be caught, logged, and captured.
- No floating/unsupervised effects.

## 9. Testing — real-seam layers with `@effect/vitest`

- **Always `@effect/vitest`.** `import { describe, it } from '@effect/vitest'`; keep `expect`/`beforeAll`/`afterAll`
  from `vitest`. The Slack `ManagedRuntime` + plain-vitest tests are **legacy** — write new tests with `it.effect`.
- **`it.effect('…', () => Effect.gen(function*(){ … }).pipe(Effect.provide(layer)))`.** No `ManagedRuntime`, no
  manual `runPromise`/`dispose`.
- **Build the layer** behind a `makeLayer(opts)` factory:
  `Layer.provideMerge(ServiceLive, Layer.mergeAll(PostgresDbLive(db), …fakes, ConfigProvider…))`.
- **Substitute each dep by category:** real ephemeral DB (`PostgresDbLive(db)` + `createTestDb`) for persistence
  behavior; a hand-fake `PostgresDb` layer for pure-logic-over-DB; `Layer.succeed(Service, {...})` recording-store
  fakes for true externals (unused methods `Effect.die('… not used')`); a fake `HttpClient` layer or loopback
  server for transport; `ConfigProvider.fromUnknown({...})` for config.
- **Test the implementing layer directly.** Keep its external dependencies in `R`, then provide fake transports or
  other test layers with `Layer.provide`; do not create a second `…Base` production layer solely for tests.
- **Assert on both** the returned value / narrowed error **and** real side-effect end-state (DB rows via
  `Effect.promise(() => db.select()…)`, recording-store contents).
- **Banned:** `vi.mock`, `vi.spyOn`, module patching, method spies. If a dep can't be swapped via a layer, the
  module is wrong (hidden/ambient/arg-passed) — fix the module, not the test.

## 10. TypeScript contracts (must-haves)

No `any`, no `!`, no unjustified `as` (escape hatches are local, behind precise interfaces, with a `SAFETY:`
comment + lint-disable reason). `readonly` by default. `??` not `||` for "absent" defaults; no `filter(Boolean)`.
`import type` for type-only imports; no barrels; JSDoc on exports. Guard clauses (no `else` after `return`).
`Map`/`Set` for dynamic keyed collections. Precise file names — no `utils.ts`/`helpers.ts` dumping grounds.

parse, don't validate. Avoid `x?.y` accessors and `typeof` operations.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Public surface small, domain-shaped; per-method error union narrow + distinct from internal.
- [ ] Errors are `Data.TaggedError`, model caller actions; classified in-channel; **one** SDK-error mapper.
- [ ] Capture (log + Sentry) happens on the raw error **before** narrowing/swallowing; `catchCause` at top nets.
- [ ] `Effect.withSpan` on every public method; safe annotations; secrets `Redacted`.
- [ ] All deps in `R`; no service/layer/effect passed as an argument; no errors-as-values.
- [ ] Config via `Config.*`; secrets `Redacted`, unwrapped only at the edge.
- [ ] Tests use `@effect/vitest` `it.effect` + `Effect.provide(layer)`; real seams; no `vi.mock`/`vi.spyOn`;
      assert value **and** persisted end-state.
- [ ] No `instanceof`, no `error._tag === '…'`, no plain `(cause) => Error` classifiers.
