# Satelle Setup

Bootstrap Satelle without hiding consent or secrets. Prefer planning first, then apply only after the user has approved the exact mutation path.

## Steps

1. Inspect the target context.

Run `satelle config check --json`, then `satelle config explain --json` for the selected host and profile when available.

Completion criterion: local config is valid or the agent has a typed configuration error and suggested commands.

2. Build a setup plan.

Run `satelle setup --host <alias> --no-input --json` for agent-safe planning. Add `--component <name>` only when the user asked for a targeted setup flow.

Completion criterion: the agent has `planned_actions`, `required_input`, `readiness_summary`, and `recovery_commands`.

3. Handle provider auth as references, not secrets.

Use host-resolved Secret Source descriptors such as environment, file, credential-store, or host-store references. Do not ask the user to paste raw provider secrets into the agent conversation.

Completion criterion: any missing provider auth is represented as a descriptor or as a user action requirement, never as raw secret text.

4. Separate consent from configuration.

If the setup plan contains mutations, ask the user before using `--yes`. Project config, ordinary profile selection, YOLO mode, and prior prompts are not mutation consent. An applicable Trusted Profile can grant ordinary mutation consent only when an explicitly selected user-owned profile names it for the exact Host and command family. It cannot authorize provider-secret entry or replacement.

Completion criterion: either no mutation is needed, the user explicitly approved the exact setup command, or an applicable user-owned Trusted Profile grants setup consent for the exact Host.

5. Verify readiness.

After setup, run `satelle doctor --scope computer-use --refresh --json` and provider refresh when the selected provider requires Computer Use validation.

For runtimes or providers that claim pointer control, treat drag gestures as a separate readiness signal from simple clicks when the current binary exposes that diagnostic detail.

Completion criterion: readiness is ready, or the agent reports typed blockers with the next recovery command.

## MCP And Client Setup

Prefer an MCP client installation dry run first:

```bash
satelle mcp install --target codex --dry-run --json
```

Apply only after the user accepts the target, server name, and Satelle binary path. Add `--enable-mutations` only when the user also accepts exposing run, steer, stop, setup, repair, host update, and host lifecycle tools. Enabling those tools does not grant mutation consent. Each tool retains the equivalent CLI consent, Trusted Profile, YOLO, readiness, provider, and host-busy rules.

Completion criterion: the AI client points to the intended Satelle MCP server command, or the dry run explains what would change.
